My experience in managing laboratories, conducting statistical analysis, and implementing machine learning models has given me the skills and confidence to tackle any challenge. 

I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest statistical models and utilizing data visualization to effectively communicate insights. I believe that my background in chemistry gives me a unique perspective in the field of data science and I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to drive decision-making and make an impact. I believe that data will play a crucial role in shaping the future and I am excited to be a part of that transformation.
